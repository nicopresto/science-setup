# Scientific programming setup

## Background
My colleagues and I have developed these notes over the years, as we've configured and re-configured our machines for scientific analysis and software development. We constantly oscillate between linux on our desktops and our Macbooks. 

These notes come with no guarantee, they may not work a week from now. However, they reflect the last time one of us needed to configure a machine or VM.

Hope they're useful.
